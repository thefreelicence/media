# Media files of The FREE Licence Project

Here you can find a collection of certain images for use in conjuction with a FREE Licence. 
You’ll find small pixel-perfect images for screen as well as hi-res CMYK files
 for use in professional print production.


## A note about CMYK files
Files in CMYK colour space do not carry an embedded color profile as long as they’re basically black and white.
 The CMYK colour values (deep black and off-white) are set in a way, that should look good with any industrial output process, so that no additional colour conversion
 is necessary — indeed, it would even be detrimental to print quality, should CMYK values be “randomly” re-calculated into another colour space.
 We recommend leaving the values as they are, unless you really know what you’re doing.
